Semi-Autonomous Smart Contracts.
Semi because contract methods can only be called by transaction. That means someone have to commit transaction or nothing will execute. So the only solution that comes to my mind is to add monetary incentive for someone to execute those contracts. And restrict it to only one time per block. That what this smart contract does.
